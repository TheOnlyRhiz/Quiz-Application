This project is a Next.js frontend-only HTML quiz app using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It should present 20 questions per attempt, randomly selected and shuffled from a pool of at least 200 basic HTML questions, each with four options. On each new attempt, the questions should be reshuffled. Include basic navigation, scoring, and a simple, modern UI.
